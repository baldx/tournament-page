                        Hello party enthusiasts of Chess!
                        Ever felt that Chess, a game known worldwide for its intense moments, lacked a go-to hub that unites all the chess lovers? I felt the same. While countries like Russia flaunted multiple platforms catering to chess-goers, online chess seemed to lag behind. That's when the idea of BBR came to life.

                            After traveling and experiencing the chess cultures of various cities, I realized chess was missing something special - a one-stop platform for all things chess. The need became even more apparent post-Corona. Our beloved chess club scene took a hit, showing us how fragile it could be. Clubs struggled, the games quieted down, but the spirit of chess players never waned. It only made me more determined to fill this gap.

                            I embarked on this journey in early 2023. After months of research, planning, and hard work, BBR had its soft launch on the 10th of December 2023. But trust me, this is just the start. As you navigate our platform, you'll discover various features tailored for you, with many more in the pipeline. Our full-fledged launch tournament is on the horizon, but we want to ensure everything is perfect for you!

                            Curious about our mascot? We sifted through hundreds of different horse designs before settling on Henny. He, like the chess players, embodies the spirit of resilience, intelligence, and unity. Dive deeper into Hennys story below.
